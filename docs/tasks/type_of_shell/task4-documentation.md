# Task 4: Documentation Updates

## Priority

LOW - Completes the feature by documenting usage.

## Description

All user facing documentation should describe the new `type` field and provide an updated example of adding a custom shell.

## Scope

- Update `README.md` sections on configuration and shell setup.
- Expand `FAQ.md` answer about custom shells to mention that `type` must be specified and explain the possible values.
- Add short notes in `CONFIGURATION_EXAMPLES.md` or other relevant docs if needed.

## Files to Modify/Create

- `README.md`
- `docs/FAQ.md`
- Other configuration docs as appropriate.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation clearly describes the `type` property with at least one example.
2. All markdown files build without linting errors.
