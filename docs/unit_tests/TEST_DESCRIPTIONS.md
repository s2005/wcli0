# Unit Test Descriptions

This document summarizes the purpose of each unit test in the project.

## tests/commandChain.test.ts

- **allows cd within allowed path** – verifies that chained commands containing a `cd` to a directory under the allowed paths list do not throw an error when validated.
- **rejects cd to disallowed path** – ensures that attempting to `cd` into a directory outside the allowed paths causes validation to throw.
- **rejects relative cd escaping allowed path** – checks that using a relative `cd ..` to leave the permitted directory is blocked.
- **rejects blocked commands and arguments in chain** – confirms that blocked commands or arguments in a chained command cause validation to fail.

## tests/commandSettings.test.ts

- **blocks dangerous operators when injection protection enabled** – ensures chained commands containing blocked shell operators are rejected when injection protection is active.
- **allows command chaining when injection protection disabled** – verifies that disabling injection protection permits safe chained commands.
- **allows changing directory outside allowed paths when restriction disabled** – confirms unrestricted working directory settings allow `cd` into disallowed paths.
- **rejects changing directory outside allowed paths when restriction enabled** – checks that enabling the restriction prevents `cd` to directories beyond the allowed list.

## tests/conditionalShells.test.ts

- **WSL only included with explicit configuration** – ensures the WSL shell is available only when the `wsl` shell is specified in configuration.
- **backward compatibility with explicit shell list** – specifying all shells explicitly retains each shell entry in the loaded config.
- **assigns validatePath and blockedOperators for shells** – enabled shells have default path validators and blocked operator lists populated.

## tests/configNormalization.test.ts

- **loadConfig lower-cases and normalizes allowedPaths** – tests that loading configuration normalizes path casing and formats allowed paths consistently.
- **loadConfig fills missing security settings with defaults** – verifies that any security settings not supplied in the config file are populated with default values.
- **includeDefaultWSL setting is ignored (deprecated)** – ensures deprecated `includeDefaultWSL` in the security section does not enable WSL.

## tests/configValidation.test.ts

- **throws for nonpositive maxCommandLength** – ensures validation rejects negative or zero maxCommandLength values.
- **throws for enabled shell missing executable fields** – detects incomplete shell executable settings.
- **throws for commandTimeout below 1** – enforces a minimum timeout of one second.
- **passes for valid configuration** – confirms that a properly formed config does not throw.

## tests/defaultConfig.test.ts

- **writes default config without validatePath functions** – verifies that the file created by `createDefaultConfig` omits runtime validation functions.

## tests/directoryValidator.test.ts

- **should return valid for directories within allowed paths** – validates that directories contained in the allowed list are accepted.
- **should return invalid for directories outside allowed paths** – checks that directories outside the whitelist are reported as invalid.
- **should handle a mix of valid and invalid directories** – ensures that only the directories outside the allowed paths are listed as invalid.
- **should handle GitBash style paths** – confirms that Unix-style paths like `/c/Users/...` are normalized and validated correctly.
- **should consider invalid paths that throw during normalization** – tests that paths causing normalization errors are treated as invalid.
- **should not throw for valid directories** – verifies that the throwing validator passes silently when all directories are allowed.
- **should throw McpError for invalid directories** – checks that a custom error is thrown when invalid directories are found.
- **should include invalid directories in error message** – ensures the thrown error lists each offending directory and allowed paths for clarity.
- **should use singular wording for a single invalid directory** – tests that the error message uses singular phrasing when only one directory is invalid.
- **should handle empty directories array** – confirms that validating an empty list of directories succeeds.
- **should handle empty allowed paths array** – ensures that an empty allowed path configuration results in an error when validating directories.

## tests/getConfig.test.ts

- **createSerializableConfig returns structured configuration** – verifies that `createSerializableConfig` produces a plain object without functions and with the expected fields from the configuration.
- **createSerializableConfig returns consistent config structure** – checks that the structure of the serialized config always contains the necessary keys for security and shell settings.
- **get_config tool response format** – ensures the response format produced by the configuration tool is correctly shaped and contains the serialized config.

## tests/initialDirConfig.test.ts

- **valid initialDir with restriction adds to allowedPaths** – verifies that a provided initial directory is normalized and added to `allowedPaths` when `restrictWorkingDirectory` is true.
- **valid initialDir without restriction leaves allowedPaths unchanged** – ensures the path is normalized but not appended when restrictions are disabled.
- **invalid initialDir logs warning and is undefined** – an invalid path triggers a warning and the setting becomes `undefined`.
- **initialDir omitted results in undefined** – confirms the default when no `initialDir` is specified.
- **non-string initialDir preserved when null without warning** – a `null` value remains in the configuration and does not trigger a warning.

## tests/initialDirCliOverride.test.ts

- **overrides config initialDir and updates allowedPaths** – applying the CLI option replaces the configured `initialDir` with the provided path and appends it to `allowedPaths`.
- **invalid directory logs warning and does not override** – supplying a nonexistent directory causes a warning and the original configuration remains unchanged.

## tests/shellCliOverride.test.ts

- **enables only selected shell and sets allowed directories** – activating the CLI flag disables other shells, updates global and shell-specific `allowedPaths`, and enforces working directory restriction.

## tests/securityCliOverride.test.ts

- **overrides security values with valid numbers** – valid `maxCommandLength` and `commandTimeout` values update the configuration when provided via CLI.
- **logs warning and ignores invalid values** – zero or negative numbers trigger a warning and leave the original security settings intact.

## tests/wslMountPointCliOverride.test.ts

- **overrides mount point for WSL and Bash shells** – applying the CLI option changes the `mountPoint` for both WSL and Bash shell configurations.
- **ignores when mount point is undefined** – omitting the value leaves existing mount points unchanged.

## tests/restrictionCliOverride.test.ts

- **overrides restriction arrays from CLI** – passing values replaces the default lists for commands, arguments, and operators.
- **empty strings clear defaults entirely** – providing an empty string results in no restrictions for that category.

## tests/serverCwdInitialization.test.ts

- **launch outside allowed paths leaves cwd undefined** – starting the server in a disallowed directory results in no active working directory.
- **execute_command fails when cwd undefined** – commands without a workingDir return an error when no active directory is set.
- **set_current_directory sets active cwd** – using the tool successfully changes the active directory and calls `process.chdir`.
- **get_current_directory reports unset state** – retrieving the current directory before one is set returns a helpful message.
- **initialDir sets active cwd when valid** – a valid `initialDir` is used at startup and becomes the active directory.
- **initialDir chdir failure falls back to process.cwd()** – if changing to `initialDir` fails the server falls back to the process directory.
- **initialDir not in allowedPaths leaves active cwd undefined** – when restrictions prevent using the configured `initialDir`, the active directory remains unset.

## tests/toolDescription.test.ts

- **generates correct description with all shells enabled** – checks that the tool description lists every enabled shell and includes example blocks for each.
- **generates correct description with only cmd enabled** – verifies that the description includes only the CMD example when other shells are disabled.
- **generates correct description with powershell and gitbash enabled** – ensures that only the relevant examples for enabled shells are present.
- **handles empty allowed shells array** – confirms that an empty shell list results in a minimal description without examples.
- **handles unknown shell names** – tests that unrecognized shell names appear in the header but no examples are generated.

## tests/toolDescription.details.test.ts

- **buildExecuteCommandDescription includes shell summaries and examples** – verifies that the detailed description lists each enabled shell with sample usage.

- **removes nested subpaths** – verifies that nested allowed paths are collapsed to the parent path.
- **keeps multiple top-level paths** – multiple unrelated allowed paths remain after normalization.
- **isPathAllowed validates paths correctly** – checks standard cases of allowed and disallowed path validation.
- **isPathAllowed handles trailing slashes correctly** – ensures trailing slashes in either path do not affect validation.

## tests/wsl.test.ts

This file contains unit tests specifically for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) shell integration.
It utilizes a Node.js emulator script `scripts/wsl-emulator.js` to allow tests to run on non-Windows environments where `wsl.exe` is not available. The emulator mimics the basic command execution behavior of `wsl.exe -e <command>`.
The tests also cover the correct normalization and validation of WSL paths (e.g., `/mnt/c/...`) when used as working directories, particularly the fixes made in `normalizeWindowsPath`.

- **`should execute a simple command via WSL emulator`**: Verifies basic command execution (e.g., `echo`) using the `wsl` shell and checks for correct output.
- **`should handle commands that result in an error`**: Ensures that commands exiting with a non-zero status code are correctly reported as errors, with the appropriate exit code.
- **`should capture stderr output`**: Tests that stderr output from commands executed in WSL is captured and returned in the command result.
- **`should block commands with prohibited shell operators`**: Confirms that injection protection works for the WSL shell, blocking commands with operators like `;`.
- **`WSL Working Directory Validation`**: This suite of tests (5.1, 5.2, 5.3) validates the working directory functionality for WSL:
  - **`should execute command in valid WSL working directory when allowed` (Test 5.1)**: Verifies that a command can be executed when its `workingDir` is a valid WSL path (e.g., `/mnt/c/some_dir`) and this path is correctly normalized and listed in `allowedPaths`.
  - **`should reject command in invalid WSL working directory (different root)` (Test 5.2)**: Ensures commands are rejected if their `workingDir` is a WSL path on a different/disallowed root (e.g., `/mnt/d/...` when only `/mnt/c/...` is allowed).
  - **`should reject command in invalid WSL working directory (disallowed suffix)` (Test 5.3)**: Ensures commands are rejected if their `workingDir` is a WSL path that is not covered by any entry in `allowedPaths`.

## tests/wslEmulator.test.ts

- **emulator handles basic commands** – verifies that the Node-based WSL emulator executes simple commands like `echo`.
- **emulator propagates exit codes** – ensures exit codes from commands run through the emulator are returned.
- **pwd returns current directory** – checks that the emulator prints the working directory when running `pwd`.
- **ls /tmp returns simulated output** – confirms the emulator returns a stub directory listing for `ls /tmp`.

## tests/processManagement.test.ts

- **should terminate process on timeout** – ensures that a long-running command is killed after exceeding the configured timeout.
- **should handle process spawn errors gracefully** – verifies that spawn failures throw a descriptive `McpError`.
- **should propagate shell process errors** – checks that errors emitted by the spawned process reject the command.
- **should clear timeout when process exits normally** – confirms that the timeout is cleared and the process is not killed when it finishes before the limit.

## tests/testCleanup.test.ts

- **ensures no residual open handles between tests** – placeholder verification that global cleanup completes without warnings.

## tests/asyncOperations.test.ts

- **should handle concurrent command executions** – runs multiple commands in parallel and verifies that each completes successfully.
- **should queue commands when limit reached** – ensures additional commands wait when a concurrency limit is exceeded.
- **should handle concurrent errors independently** – confirms that failures in one command do not affect others running at the same time.

## tests/errorHandling.test.ts

- **should handle malformed JSON-RPC requests** – invalid tool parameters result in an `InvalidParams` error.
- **should recover from shell crashes** – spawning a nonexistent shell command triggers an `InternalError` with details from the spawn failure.
- **should throw error on invalid configuration** – loading a config with invalid values raises an exception.
- **should fall back to defaults when config read fails** – if reading the config file throws, defaults are returned and an error is logged.

## tests/wsl/pathConversion.test.ts

- **convertWindowsToWslPath handles standard and mixed separators** – converts typical Windows paths, forward slashes and mixed separators to `/mnt/<drive>/` form.
- **handles drive roots and trailing slashes** – correctly processes paths like `C:/` and `C:\\Users\\`.
- **supports custom mount points and paths with spaces** – allows overriding the mount root and preserves spaces during conversion.
- **returns non-Windows paths unchanged and rejects UNC paths** – Unix-style or relative paths pass through while UNC paths throw an error.

## tests/wsl/pathResolution.test.ts

- **resolves allowed paths based on global and WSL-specific settings** – merges and converts Windows paths, respecting the `inheritGlobalPaths` flag.
- **ensures unique results and warns about unsupported UNC paths** – duplicates are removed and a warning is logged when global paths cannot be converted.
- **honors custom `wslMountPoint` values** – converted paths reflect the configured mount prefix.

## tests/wsl/validateWslWorkingDirectory.test.ts

- **accepts valid WSL directories from global or shell-specific lists** – directories under resolved allowed paths are permitted.
- **rejects directories outside the allowed set or with invalid format** – errors are thrown for disallowed roots, relative paths or Windows-style paths.
- **supports custom mount points and ignores unsupported global UNC paths** – validation uses the configured mount prefix and logs warnings for skipped UNC paths.

## tests/wsl/isWslPathAllowed.test.ts

- **matches allowed and disallowed paths including `/mnt/<drive>` conversion** – parameterized cases verify path allowance and drive mount handling.

## tests/pathValidation.edge.test.ts

- **WSL converts Windows paths before validation** – ensures Windows style paths are converted to `/mnt/` form for checking.
- **WSL rejects paths outside allowed list after conversion** – disallowed paths remain blocked even after conversion.
- **GitBash accepts Windows and Unix style paths** – verifies both `C:\` and `/c/` formats are permitted when allowed.
- **throws when allowedPaths empty** – validation fails if no allowed paths are configured.

## tests/configMerge.test.ts

- **handles user config enabling subset of shells** – merging honours explicit enable/disable flags while keeping defaults for others.
- **uses defaults when sections omitted** – missing global sections retain default values during merge.
- **omitted shells retain defaults** – unspecified shells are included with default configuration.

## tests/emptyRestrictions.test.ts

- **global empty arrays remove all restrictions** – specifying empty arrays removes all default blocked commands, arguments, and operators.
- **shell config without restriction overrides** – default shell restrictions are not inherited when overrides omit them.

## tests/integration/endToEnd.test.ts

- **should execute shell command with proper isolation** – uses the helper server to run a command end‑to‑end and verifies the output and working directory metadata.

## tests/integration/mcpProtocol.test.ts

- **should return configuration via get_config tool** – parses the JSON response and ensures required keys are present.
- **should validate directories correctly** – calling the directory validation tool succeeds for allowed paths.

## tests/integration/shellExecution.test.ts

- **should reject commands with blocked operators** – executing a command containing `;` results in an `McpError`.
- **should enforce working directory restrictions** – commands fail when executed from disallowed directories.
- **should execute when working directory allowed** – succeeds when the directory is permitted by the configuration.

## tests/handlers/resourceTemplatesHandler.test.ts

- **returns empty template list** – verifies that the ListResourceTemplates handler responds with an empty array.
